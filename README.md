# git-script

UCLA CS97 Assignment 6 <br/>

This script generates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) based off the commits of a git repository. Each commit can be thought of as a vertice. <br/>

Tasks in this script <br/>
1: Discover the .git directory  <br/>
2: Get the list of local branch name  <br/>
3: Build the commit graph  <br/>
4: Generate a topological ordering of the commits in the graph  <br/>
5: Print the commit hashes in the order generated by the previous step, from the least to the greatest  <br/>
